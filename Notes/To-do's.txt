# CompGIT to-do list 

Clarify the comments in SImpleGroup.oy and GIT.py to make the code readable 
- e.g. in SimpleGroup.SimpleGroup: “ #From gamma-coordinates to H-coordinates. Return rays of F in H-coordinates. ” 
- Fix some notation and adding clarifications to the existing comments would help the user 

Complete all doctest comments/examples in SimpleGroup.py and GIT.py 
- Add examples of outputs for key functions and classes, following sagemamth standard notation

Explore if we need other doctest files in the repository
- e.g. https://gitlab.com/modulispaces/admcycles/-/blob/master/_doctest_environment.py?ref_type=heads

Rewrite README.txt 

Setup tests (look into this asap)
- As advised by sage_devel user vdelecroix at https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/02V0y-EnEJ4
- e.g. https://gitlab.com/modulispaces/admcycles/-/tree/master/tests?ref_type=heads

Confirm if it is correct to leave __init__.py empty
- For admcycles (https://gitlab.com/modulispaces/admcycles/-/blob/master/admcycles/__init__.py?ref_type=heads ) the file is not empty.
- However, the discussion at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448271/what-is-init-py-for suggests that “The __init__.py file is usually empty, but can be used to export selected portions of the package under more convenient name, hold convenience functions, etc.”

Explore if we need an examples.sage file
- e.g. https://gitlab.com/modulispaces/admcycles/-/blob/master/examples.sage?ref_type=heads 
- Use the example from https://jesusmartinezgarcia.net/git/

Explore if we need a setup.py file 
- e.g. https://gitlab.com/modulispaces/admcycles/-/blob/master/setup.py?ref_type=heads
